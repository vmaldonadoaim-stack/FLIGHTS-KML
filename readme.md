# FLIGHTS-KML

This project uses the OpenSky Network API to download, collect, and analyze historical flight data, generating detailed KML files of arrivals and departures at specific airports. The goal is to visualize air traffic patterns, study trends over time, and support educational, research, and analytical purposes.
